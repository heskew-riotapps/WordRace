	<string name="full_rules_1">The idea is to score more points than your opponent in the alloted time by forming as many valid words as possible out of the letters in your tray.</string>
   	<string name="full_rules_2">To start the game, just tap the Start button.  That kicks off the countdown timer.  Normally, the countdown timer starts at 90 seconds (unless you are playing a Speed Round or Double Time game). 
   	    			   All words must contain 3 or more letters, up to a maximum of 10 letters. 
                       Your opponent will be playing words at the same time as you - after you start the countdown timer.</string>                
 	<string name="full_rules_3">Remember to tap the letters to add them to the played word.  Don\'t drag them, it does not work.  The game was built for pure finger-tapping speed.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_4">A word can only be played once per game by either player.  Both players cannot play the same word. In the case of a Speed Rounds, words cannot be repeated across rounds.</string>  
	<string name="full_rules_5">The points per word are calculated based on the value of each letter.  Each player\'s score is calculated by adding up the points of each word the player played.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_6">When the countdown is over, the game is over.  The player with the highest score wins!</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_1">The Letters</string>
	<string name="full_rules_letters_2">Each letter has an assigned value as follows:</string>

    <string name="full_rules_dictionary_2">The original source for the dictionary is

                         We have added many words to the dictionary and are continually expanding it.
